    "# Get Started with Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. Like all artificial intelligence, generative AI is powered by machine learning models—very large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data and commonly referred to as foundation models (FMs). Apart from content creation, generative AI is also used to improve the quality of digital images, edit video, build prototypes quickly for manufacturing, augment data with synthetic datasets, and more.\n",

For details on the specific DeepSeek model version, training data, and potential limitations (such as language support or inherent biases), refer to the model's documentation or the SageMaker JumpStart page used for its deployment.\n",

    "DeepSeek models deployed through SageMaker AI often accept parameters within a JSON payload. The exact parameters depend on the specific deployment container (for example, TGI, vLLM, and DJL). Based on the reference code, a common structure for chat/instruct models involves a `messages` list and other generation controls. Common parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **messages:** A list of message objects, each with `role` ('user', 'assistant', or sometimes 'system') and `content` (the text of the message). This allows for conversational context.\n",
    "* **max_tokens** (or `max_new_tokens`): Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls randomness. Lower values (0.1-0.3) make the output more focused and deterministic; higher values (0.7-1.0) make it more creative and diverse.\n",
    "* **top_p:** Nucleus sampling parameter. Considers only the most probable tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `top_p`.\n",
    "* **stop:** A list of strings. Generation stops if the model produces any of these strings.\n",

    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering techniques—such as zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot approaches—offer different ways to guide AI models to produce desired outputs. Zero-shot prompting is the most basic approach, where you directly ask the model to perform a task without examples. Zero-shot prompting is useful for straightforward requests, but it might lack precision for complex tasks. One-shot prompting provides a single example along with the request, which helps the model understand the expected format and style of the response. Few-shot prompting takes this further by providing multiple examples, which is particularly effective for complex tasks that require pattern recognition or specific output structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear instructions are crucial across all these techniques because they reduce ambiguity and help the model understand exactly what's expected. When instructions are specific, well-structured, and include details about the desired format, context, and constraints, the model is more likely to generate accurate and relevant responses. For example, instead of asking the model to \"generate some code,\" a clear instruction might specify that the model should \"write a Python function that handles errors, includes logging, and returns JSON responses with specific fields.\"\n"

      "First, the function name is specified as `greek_philosopher_quote_lambda`, which is a bit of a name, but I guess it's just a placeholder. The main job of this function is to retrieve quotes from three famous Greek philosophers: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Each quote should be stored as a dictionary with the philosopher's name and the quote text.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also need to import the necessary libraries. The user mentioned logging, so I'll need to import the logging module. Plus, using the requests library for HTTP requests and json for JSON operations. So I'll include those imports at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the function should randomly select one quote object from the list. Each quote is a dictionary of the form {'philosopher': 'Socrates', 'quote': 'An unexamined life is not worth living.'}. So I'll need to store the list of these quote dictionaries somewhere, probably in a variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Error handling is a must. I'll use try/except blocks to catch any exceptions that might occur during the function's execution, such as network errors or requests failing. This will log the error and return a 500 status code with an appropriate message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logging is another key point. I'll import the logging library and set up the function to log the start of execution using logging.info. Also, during errors, logging.error will be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The success outcome should return a JSON-dumped dictionary with the selected philosopher and quote. For errors, it should log that an error occurred and return a 500 status with the error message.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should include comments where necessary to explain the code, but since the user asked for basic docstrings and comments, I'll write a docstring explaining the function's purpose, parameters, return values, and note about including the .env file and AWS setup in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, thinking about the structure of the function. It will start by logging the function's start. Then, in a try block, it will generate a list of three random quote dictionaries. It'll use a for loop iterating three times, each time selecting a quote with random selection. After that, it will randomly select one quote from the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "If everything goes well, it logs the selected quotes and returns the JSON-dumped dictionary. If there's an error, it catches the exception, logs the error, and returns the 500 status with the message.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider edge cases. For example, what if the API endpoints aren't correctly set up? The function should handle that gracefully but inform the user that it didn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user mentioned the .env file and AWS setup, but since I'm writing this as a script, maybe I should note that in a comment. They also asked for basic docstrings and comments, which I've done.\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to understand what AWS Lambda is. I've heard the term before, maybe in the context of cloud computing or something related to serverless functions. Let me start by breaking down the name. AWS is a big company, right? They make a lot of cloud services. Lambda must be one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember hearing about serverless functions before. They're something like functions that run on a serverless platform, which I think is a type of cloud computing service. So maybe Lambda is a specific service within that category. But I'm not entirely sure how it works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about what I know. Lambda functions are typically written in Python or JavaScript and called when a request comes in. They can handle data processing, route requests, maybe even do some database operations. But I've also heard that Lambda can run on a serverless platform, which means it doesn't need its own server. That sounds efficient because you don't have to worry about hosting your own server.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, AWS Lambda is probably a service that allows you to create and run these serverless functions. It's part of the AWS Lambda Function API, which I think is a web service that lets you create these functions. But wait, isn't there also a service that actually runs these functions? Maybe it's Lambda Function itself, which is the API, and then there's something like Lambda Function Container or Lambda Function Services.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a bit confused about the differences between these. Let me try to outline what I know:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lambda Function API**: This is the web service where you can create, manage, and run serverless functions. It's built on top of Python and can handle various tasks like processing data, routing, and even database operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lambda Function Container**: I think this is a service that runs Lambda functions on a serverless platform. It's probably a separate service that you can use to run Lambda functions without needing to interact with the Lambda API directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lambda Function Services**: These are pre-configured services that provide a set of Lambda functions. They might include common tasks like processing, routing, caching, and more. These services are probably easier to use because they're pre-built and ready to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the Lambda Function API is the main tool for creating and running these functions, while the container and services are the actual instances where these functions run. That makes sense because you don't want to build your own serverless functions from scratch; you can leverage existing tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that Lambda can be used in different environments. For example, you can run it on a local machine, on a serverless platform like AWS S3, AWS Lambda Function Container, or even on a serverless instance like AWS Lambda. This flexibility is important because it allows you to choose the best fit for your needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing I'm thinking about is how Lambda functions handle data. They can process data in various ways, like mapping, reducing, filtering, and so on. They can also handle asynchronous data, which is useful for real-time applications. Plus, they can perform database operations, which is great for data processing tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also curious about the benefits of using Lambda. Since it's serverless, it's more efficient because you don't have to manage your own servers. It's scalable, which means you can scale up or down based on demand. Plus, it's easier to deploy and maintain because you don't have to worry about infrastructure management.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not entirely sure how Lambda functions are integrated into the AWS ecosystem. Do they work with other services like S3, EKS, or Lambda Function Services? I think they can, but I'm not certain. I should probably look into how Lambda functions interact with these services to see how they can be used in different scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also wonder about the differences between Lambda Function API and Lambda Function Services. The former is the tool for creating and running functions, while the latter is the pre-configured instances. So, if I want to run a function, I'd use the API, but if I need a set of functions, I'd use the services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is the use of AWS services like S3 and EKS. Lambda can run on these services, which means you can have your Lambda functions deployed in different environments. For example, you can deploy a Lambda function on a local serverless instance, on a serverless platform, or even on a managed service like AWS S3.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also thinking about the types of tasks Lambda functions can perform. They can handle data processing, route requests, perform database operations, and even handle events. This versatility makes Lambda a powerful tool for various applications, from backend services to frontend components.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, AWS Lambda is a service that allows you to create and run serverless functions using the AWS Lambda Function API. These functions can process data, route requests, and perform database operations. They can be deployed on various AWS services like local machines, serverless platforms, or managed instances. The Lambda Function API is the main tool, while Lambda Function Services are pre-configured instances that provide common tasks. Lambda functions are efficient, scalable, and easier to deploy compared to traditional serverless solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I have a basic understanding now, but I should probably look up some examples or documentation to solidify my knowledge. Maybe checking out AWS documentation or tutorials on AWS Lambda would help clarify any gaps in my understanding.\n",
